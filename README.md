# Official README

## Word of Warning
This is loosely adapted from the campaign **Academic Conclusions** from [Roll20.net](https://roll20.net) You as a random stranger are more than welcome to download and play this game. Be warned the code that is not inside the *Fodder* folder was source code written before my plans to use a database. There could be small trace errors that occur because I didn't have time to test absolutely everything. 

## Requirements
This program was coded in python3.4 and uses the following additional packages:
- [PostgreSQL 9.4.1](http://www.postgresql.org/)
- [psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/)
    * This is used for executing PostgreSQL with Python3

## Progress
- Done
    * Base Program Written
- To Do
    * Trim exessive statements from main.py and make them methods of the *Player* class. These commits will be referred to as **Fat Trimming** in commits.
    * Convert things in player.py to use the database for as much as possible.
    * Maps.py will be changed . . . eventually
