NAME Clergy Wyma
DIALOG Hello there, you look familiar, do I know you? . . . Not much a talker
DIALOG I see. Either way you look like you might need some help. Now on a normal
DIALOG day I might just give you some money and tell you to do it in the faith of
DIALOG the lord but I have no time. I'll give you one hundred gold if you retrieve
DIALOG an item for me. I need a small glass-like key from the graveyard. Fetch it.

DIALOG I'm a clergy I can't just go robbing graves! I'm pretty sure it's on the 3rd
DIALOG floor or something. Just grab it and hurry back, time is of the essence.
