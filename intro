Hello humble man how are you this evening? No? Nothing? Not much of a talker I
see. Do you remember? No? You don't remember why you're here? You miss your
family don't you? Be careful in these forests they are rife with cannibals and 
wolves. Although I'm not sure which one is worse to be eaten by. If you LOOK 
north there is a small town and perhaps a clergy who can help you find your way.

The moon isn't out tonight, I have a spare torch you can take. It'll help you
see about ten meters in each direction. Be careful though there isn't much life
left on it. I'd say you could realisitcally Move about three thousand meters
before the light flickers away and your left alone with no vision. You're going 
to need to get right on top of buildings to see them, and the same case with
items that are just lying on the GROUND. 

Don't try to get close to people around here, they aren't the friendly sort and
will spurn any chance you take to EXAMINE them. Although if you have something 
they want or need on your person then they'll gladly force it off you and they 
might even reward you, who knows. I never thought that maybe you don't 
understand my language! How rude of me you're probably just here wondering what 
is this strange man saying to me, who is he, why is he . . . Nevermind. If you 
do understand me, take this HELP book with you. If you can't remember the basics
this book will HELP you with some ACTION.

Well it seems my time is running short. Good luck to you stranger, whoever you 
might be.
